# Open Letter to Developers

"When the spring water warms, ducks know first; now is the time for pufferfish to rise!"

Dear friend, I'm John, a Java programmer at an ordinary company. Today, I write this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation with the most sincere heart.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB`, and other AI-related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "I wanted to serve my country but had no door; coding for ten years in vain."

At the beginning of 2025, I came across Brother Xia's team's videos. I was very curious about how they achieved it. I wanted to recreate their backend service and build a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, what I've created is still just an artificial idiot—low concurrency, no soul, slow response, lots of bugs.

Brother Xia's team is our learning target. I really want to have a Xiaozhi backend service as intelligent as Brother Xia's team. But I also understand Brother Xia's decision not to open source. "One flower does not make spring; a hundred flowers blooming fills the garden." The era of AI flourishing everywhere might be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Personally, I believe what they can achieve, we can too—it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to get the scriptures."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey to get the scriptures? I think there should be no less than eighty-one tribulations. Along the way, there will inevitably be various demons, but there will also be gods helping us secretly, and people joining our scripture-seeking team.

If you find the above content funny, then I consider myself very lucky. Being able to make you laugh for five seconds in your 30,000+ days of life counts as a contribution to you.

Will the idea of a low-cost civilian Jarvis fail? I don't know, but isn't such failure very common in the lives of us ordinary people?

In the future, one thing is certain: someone will completely recreate Brother Xia's team's functionality and achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to joining hands and creating the future together.

# Appendix: Development Contribution Guide

## Project Goals

1. **Low-Cost Civilian Jarvis Solution**

2. **Intelligent Linkage with Peripheral Hardware Solution**

## Join Us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join us and contribute to the project. You can view the features we plan to implement recently at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). Features in the list that haven't been assigned yet are urgently in need of your participation. Participation methods are as follows:

### 1. Become a Regular Contributor

Fork the project, submit PRs, and after review by developers, they will be merged into the main branch.

### 2. Become a Developer

After you have submitted 3 valid PRs, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join the independent developer group to discuss the future of the project together.

## Developer Development Process

1. **Create New Branch**
   Please develop each feature point in a new branch. Branch names should be concise and clear, making the implemented functionality immediately apparent, avoiding feature conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for Review**
   After feature development is complete, please submit a PR on GitHub for other developers to review. After review approval, it will be merged into the main branch.
