# Vision Model Usage Guide

This tutorial is divided into two parts:
- Part 1: Enable vision model when running single-module xiaozhi-server
- Part 2: How to enable vision model when running full module

Before enabling the vision model, you need to prepare three things:
- You need to prepare a device with a camera, and this device has already implemented the camera calling function in Brother Xia's repository. For example, `LichuangÂ·ESP32-S3 Development Board`
- Your device firmware version is upgraded to 1.6.6 and above
- You have successfully run the basic dialogue module

## Enable Vision Model When Running Single-Module xiaozhi-server

### Step 1: Confirm Network
Since the vision model will start port 8003 by default.

If you are running with docker, please confirm whether your `docker-compose.yml` has exposed port `8003`. If not, update to the latest `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you are running from source code, confirm whether the firewall allows port `8003`

### Step 2: Select Your Vision Model
Open your `data/.config.yaml` file, set your `selected_module.VLLM` to a certain vision model. Currently, we support vision models with `openai` type interface. `ChatGLMVLLM` is one of the models compatible with `openai`.

```
selected_module:
  VAD: ..
  ASR: ..
  LLM: ..
  VLLM: ChatGLMVLLM
  TTS: ..
  Memory: ..
  Intent: ..
```

Assuming we use `ChatGLMVLLM` as the vision model, we need to first log in to the [Zhipu AI](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys) website to apply for a key. If you have already applied for a key before, you can reuse this key.

In your configuration file, add this configuration. If you already have this configuration, set your api_key.

```
VLLM:
  ChatGLMVLLM:
    api_key: your api_key
```

### Step 3: Start xiaozhi-server Service
If you are using source code, enter the command to start:
```
python app.py
```

If you are running with docker, restart the container:
```
docker restart xiaozhi-esp32-server
```

After starting, it will output logs with the following content.

```
2025-06-01 **** - OTA interface is           http://192.168.4.7:8003/xiaozhi/ota/
2025-06-01 **** - Vision analysis interface is        http://192.168.4.7:8003/mcp/vision/explain
2025-06-01 **** - Websocket address is       ws://192.168.4.7:8000/xiaozhi/v1/
2025-06-01 **** - =======The above address is a websocket protocol address, please do not access with a browser=======
2025-06-01 **** - To test websocket, please open test_page.html in the test directory with Google Chrome
2025-06-01 **** - =============================================================
```

After starting, use your browser to open the `Vision analysis interface` link. What does it output? If you are on linux without a browser, you can execute this command:
```
curl -i your vision analysis interface
```

Normally, it will display like this:
```
MCP Vision interface is running normally, vision explanation interface address is: http://xxxx:8003/mcp/vision/explain
```

Please note, if you are deploying on a public network or using docker, you must modify this configuration in your `data/.config.yaml`:
```
server:
  vision_explain: http://your ip or domain:port/mcp/vision/explain
```

Why? Because the vision explanation interface needs to be sent to the device. If your address is a LAN address or a docker internal address, the device cannot access it.

If your public network address is `111.111.111.111`, then `vision_explain` should be configured like this:

```
server:
  vision_explain: http://111.111.111.111:8003/mcp/vision/explain
```

If your MCP Vision interface is running normally and you have tried to access the delivered `Vision explanation interface address` with your browser and it opened normally, please continue to the next step.

### Step 4: Device Wake Up

Tell the device "Please open the camera and tell me what you see"

Pay attention to the xiaozhi-server log output to see if there are any errors.


## How to Enable Vision Model When Running Full Module

### Step 1: Confirm Network
Since the vision model will start port 8003 by default.

If you are running with docker, please confirm whether your `docker-compose_all.yml` has mapped port `8003`. If not, update to the latest `docker-compose_all.yml` file.

If you are running from source code, confirm whether the firewall allows port `8003`

### Step 2: Confirm Your Configuration File

Open your `data/.config.yaml` file, confirm whether the structure of your configuration file is the same as `data/config_from_api.yaml`. If not, or if a certain item is missing, please add it.

### Step 3: Configure Vision Model Key

We need to first log in to the [Zhipu AI](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys) website to apply for a key. If you have already applied for a key before, you can reuse this key.

Log in to the `Control Console`, click `Model Configuration` in the top menu, click `Vision Large Language Model` in the left sidebar, find `VLLM_ChatGLMVLLM`, click the Modify button, in the pop-up box, enter your key in `API Key`, and click Save.

After saving successfully, go to the agent you need to test, click `Configure Role`, in the opened content, check whether `Vision Large Language Model (VLLM)` has selected the vision model just now. Click Save.

### Step 3: Start xiaozhi-server Module
If you are using source code, enter the command to start:
```
python app.py
```

If you are running with docker, restart the container:
```
docker restart xiaozhi-esp32-server
```

After starting, it will output logs with the following content.

```
